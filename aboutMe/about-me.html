          I'm a passionate software developer, who loves designing, implementing
          and discussing products. Being a successful professional software
          developer for more than 2 years, I can say that this passion is only
          getting bigger by seeing how amazing my efforts have been converted
          into revenue, customer happiness and of course a great sense of
          fulfillment. Being open minded for new technologies and approaches is
          what I believe that it keeps us disrupting software development and
          delivering products that stands out in the market. 
          My long run goal is to become a software engineer.

          In my free time I love to spend time with who I love, specially my
          wife. Reading books on different topics like philosophy,
          religion and general culture also helps refreshing myself, making me
          new every day I wake up. I also help the local church I attend, which
          I can summarize as a way to give something back. I think life can be
          have great meaning when you are grateful for what you have and are
          open to see the small things that fills our everyday life as a grace
          given to us.
